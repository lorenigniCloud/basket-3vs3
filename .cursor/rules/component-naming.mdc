What I mean is that the component must always be instiantiated with the const keyword and not the function; when expressively needed, remember to inject props implementing an interface and then decustring in the body of the component.

Example:

interface DashboardPageProps{
    prop1: string
    prop2: string
}

const DashboardPage = (props: DashboardPageProps)  => {
    const {prop1, prop2} = props;
    return (<> TSX </>);
};


export default DashboardPage;
